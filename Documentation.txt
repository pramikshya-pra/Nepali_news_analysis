##------------ Document methodology, experiments, and findings clearly--------------##

1. Introduction

This project focuses on building an AI-based Nepali News Classification System that automatically categorizes Nepali news articles into predefined categories such as Politics, Sports, Economy, Art, Society, Blog, and others.
The system is designed to strengthen practical skills in:

    * Natural Language Processing (NLP)

    * Machine Learning (ML)

    * Real-world AI system development


2. Data Collection Methodology

2.1 - Data Source: 
    Nepali news articles were collected through web scraping from a reliable Nepali news portal "Setopati.com".

2.2 Scraping Technique: 

    1. Programming Language: Python
    2. Library Used: BeautifulSoup
    3. Approach:
        * Category-wise scraping (Politics, Sports, Economy, etc.)
        * Extracted:
            - Category name
            - News headline
            - Full article content (Nepali text)

2.3 Dataset Structure: 
Each data record contains:
    1. Category
    2. Headline
    3. Content
The scraped data was stored in CSV format, making it suitable for ML workflows.


3. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

3.1 Challenges faced in Nepali Text:

    1. No standard Nepali stopword list
    2. Presence of symbols, punctuation, and mixed English text
    3. Unicode-specific text handling

3.2 Cleaning Steps Applied:

    1. Removed English characters and digits.
    2. Removed special symbols and punctuation.
    3. Retained only Nepali Unicode characters (Devanagari range).
    4. Tokenized text using whitespace.
    5. Removed custom Nepali stopwords.
    6. Normalized spacing.

3.3 Output:

A new column clean_content was created, which contains clean, normalized Nepali text ready 
for feature extraction.


4. Feature Engineering

4.1 TF-IDF Vectorization:
    To convert text into numerical features, TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) 
    was used.

    Configuration:

    * Maximum features: 5000
    * N-grams: Unigrams and Bigrams (it helps to find nepali phrages)
    * Removed extremely rare and overly frequent words

4.2 Why TF-IDF?:

* Language independent (works well for Nepali)
* Reduces importance of common words
* Highlights discriminative terms
* Efficient and scalable


5. Model Development (Experiments)

Three classical machine learning models were trained and evaluated.
    
5.1 Naive Bayes (Baseline Model):

    * Model: Multinomial Naive Bayes
    * Purpose: Establish a fast and simple baseline
    * Observation:
        - Fast training
        - Reasonable accuracy
        - Limited ability to capture complex patterns

5.2 Logistic Regression: 

* Linear classification model
* Better handling of overlapping features
* Observation:
    - Improved accuracy over Naive Bayes
    - Stable and interpretable results

5.3 Support Vector Machine (SVM):

* Model: Linear SVM
* Designed for high-dimensional sparse data
* Observation:
    - Best overall performance
    - High precision and recall
    - Most suitable for text classification tasks


6. Model Evaluation

6.1 Evaluation Metrics Used:

    1. Accuracy
    2. Precision
    3. Recall
    4. F1-score
    5. Confusion Matrix

6.2 Results Summary:

Model                            Performance                Remarks               
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Naive Bayes    --------------> Good    ---------------> Strong baseline     
2. Logistic Regression ---------> Better -------->   Better performance than Naive Bayes 
3. SVM           ----------------> Best than previous  -------> Chosen as final model


In sum,
The SVM model achieved the highest F1-score, indicating strong classification capability across
multiple categories.


7. Key Findings:

1. Classical ML models perform effectively for Nepali text classification when combined with proper preprocessing.
2. TF-IDF with n-grams significantly improves model performance.
3. SVM outperformed Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression in terms of accuracy and F1-score.
4. A clean preprocessing pipeline is critical for Nepali-language NLP tasks.


8. Limitations:

1. Nepali stopword list may not cover all Nepali variations.
2. Dataset size can be expanded for better generalization.
3. No deep learning or transformer-based model used in the current phase.
